# Overview

<img src="./doc/images/overview/PT%20hero%20image.png"/>

Microsoft PowerToys is a set of utilities for power users to tune and streamline their Windows experience for greater productivity. Inspired by the [Windows 95 era PowerToys project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerToys), this reboot provides power users with ways to squeeze more efficiency out of the Windows 10 shell and customize it for individual workflows.  A great overview of the Windows 95 PowerToys can be found [here](https://socket3.wordpress.com/2016/10/22/using-windows-95-powertoys/).

### Keyboard Manager

### PowerRename

[<img align="left" src="./doc/images/overview/PowerRename_small.PNG" />](https://aka.ms/PowerToysOverview_PowerRename) [PowerRename](https://aka.ms/PowerToysOverview_PowerRename) is a Windows Shell Extension for advanced bulk renaming using search and replace or regular expressions. PowerRename allows simple search and replace or more advanced regular expression matching. While you type in the search and replace input fields, the preview area will show what the items will be renamed to. PowerRename then calls into the Windows Explorer file operations engine to perform the rename. This has the benefit of allowing the rename operation to be undone after PowerRename exits. This code is based on [Chris Davis's SmartRename](https://github.com/chrdavis/SmartRename).

- Have [.NET Core 3.1 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.4-windows-x64-installer). The installer will prompt this but we want to directly make people aware.

### Via GitHub with MSI [Recommended]

Install from the [Microsoft PowerToys GitHub releases page][github-release-link]. Click on `Assets` to show the files available in the release and then click on `PowerToysSetup-0.19.0-x64.msi` to download the PowerToys installer.

**Note:** After installing, you will have to start PowerToys for the first time.  We will improve install experience this moving forward but due to a possible install dependency, we can't start after install currently.

This is our preferred method.

### Via WinGet (Preview)

## What's Happening

### June 2020 Update

Our goals for 0.19 release cycle had one big goal, add in stability / quality fixes. We've addressed over 100 issues across all our utilities. We've improved our installer experience and parts will start coming online in 0.19 and 0.20.  In this release, it will be the last time during upgrade you'll see Windows Explorer flash on you. For 0.20, the .NET Core install experience much smoother.

We'd also stress feedback is critical. We know there are areas for improvement on PowerToys Run. We would love feedback so we can improve. We also would love to know if you want us to be more aggressive on auto-upgrading.

Lastly, we'd like to thank everyone who filed a bug, gave feedback or made a pull-request. The PowerToys team is extremely grateful to have the support of an amazing active community.

- We shipped [v0.19][github-release-link]!
- Big push for PowerToys Run search quality fixes
- PowerToys Run can now remap to any key shortcut (minus restricted ones such as WinKey+L)
- Improved FancyZones on Virtual Desktops and multi-thread design
- Installer after 0.19 will no longer restart Windows Explorer
- Fixed [#2012 - Uninstalling with old control panel fails](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/2012)
- Fixed [#3384 - PowerToys Settings window is empty](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/3384)
- Over 100 bug fixes!

For [0.20](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+project%3Amicrosoft%2FPowerToys%2F6), we are proactively working on:

- Stability
